#### Naming

Meerkats are small canivores living in all parts of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana, in much of the Namib Desert in Namibia and southwestern Angola, and in South Africa (from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meerkat)). Meerkats are very social animals, as they tend to live in clans. It is common to see clans of meerkats standing **aligned**.
